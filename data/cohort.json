It wasn't until I started coding that I felt like I had the tools to make an impact. For me, software development combines everything I love about learning and problem solving. It fuels my imagination and brings order to chaos. It always pushes me learn more and seek a deeper understanding. We have a saying in my house, \"I can do all things through Google who strengthens me\". There's nothing like the power of the internet combined with a can-do attitude. I would know. It has taken me far. ",
